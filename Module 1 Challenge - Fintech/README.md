# Robo Advisors

## Overview and Origin
The first Robo-advisor Betterment came to market in 2010 and was developed by a 30 year-old entrepreneur. Robo-advisors provide portfolio management in an automated and algorithmic based approach. While this sort of capability had been in use by financial services since the early 2000's it wasn't until 2008 that the technology become available to general public.

Today, Robo-advisors generally bring the customer through a series of questions to ascertain their risk tolerance and other target returns. At that point the Robo-advisor provides recommendations on asset allocation and tend to steer more toward exchange-traded funds. A strong appeal of Robo-advisors is the competitive fees compared to the services of a human advisor. Robo-advisor feeds tend to range from 0.2%-1.0% of AUM compared to the average of 1.35% for a traditional financial planner.

The primary point and argument for Robo-advisors is that algorithm-based portoflio allocation address biases and limited insight that investors have. Making decisions based on data and at a much faster capacity removes the human and error-prone element to investment decisions.

## Landscape:

As stated before, the first Robo-advisor came to market in 2008. Today there are hundreds of offerings available to retail investors. In the US, the total market AUM is expected to reach $1.17T and with a compounded annual growth rate of 14.6% out through 2027 that is expected to surpass $2T. With user growth expected to reach 49M by that time the AUM per user will grow from $16k to $40k.

## Results & Recommendations

Given the nature of Robo-advisors tend toward passive investing, expected returns advertised range from 2-6% per year. If comparing to S&P500 performance over a 5 year period through 11/2022 where the index fund by Vanguard (VOO) achieved a 10.9% yearly return, then an investor is sure to be disappointed. However, the increase in AUM over the last 15 years can't understate the growing popularity of the off-hands approach in using a Robo-advisor. If an investor seeks a human element or more active and specific portfolio strategies they would be better served by a human financial advisor.
