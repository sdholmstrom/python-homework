## Module 18 Summary

This module challenge tasked us with creating a streamlit app that allows the user to input several fields: a "sender", "receiver", and "amount". The transaction based on these inputs is then recorded onto the block and stored for future viewing. The images below provide validation the app successfully has recorded multiple transactions.
